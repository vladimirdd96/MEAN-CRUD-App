The assigned task entailed the development of a sophisticated web application scripted in NodeJs. This dynamic application affords users the capability to seamlessly perform CRUD operations on companies, offices, and employees. A company, characterized by a name and creation date, may host multiple offices, each defined by country, city, street, street number, documents (restricted to word files and PDFs), and headquarters status. Employees, possessing attributes such as first name, last name, start date, salary, vacation days, experience level (junior, mid, senior), and image, can work across different offices, offering the flexibility of relocation for summer. The application mandates completeness with all fields being mandatory. Moreover, an efficient search functionality is integrated across all entities, enabling users to search companies by name, offices by country, city, or street, and employees by first name or last name.<br>
